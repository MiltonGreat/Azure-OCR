# Azure-OCR

In this project, I explored Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Azure to extract text from scanned forms and documents. Using machine learning models in Azure, I built a system that can automatically read and extract data from invoices, receipts, and scanned documents, significantly reducing manual data entry.

What I Learned: I learned how OCR can automate the extraction of information from paper documents, transforming unstructured data into structured formats for easier analysis. This process is essential for industries dealing with large volumes of paperwork, such as finance, healthcare, and logistics.

For companies with lots of unstructured document data, Azure OCR is an excellent solution to automate data extraction. It reduces errors, saves time, and allows businesses to integrate document processing seamlessly into their workflows.
